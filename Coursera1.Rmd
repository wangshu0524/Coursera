This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#read in data#

train <- read.csv("/Users/wangshu/desktop/pml-training.csv", header = T, )

#check zero covariates#

library(caret)

nsv <- nearZeroVar(train, saveMetrics = TRUE)

# no vriable is zero #

# check NA #

na <- apply(train, 2, function(x) sum(x %in% NA))

# we see many na(s) so we would delete these #

keep <- which(na == 0)

train1 <- train [,keep]

#saw some empty cell, detect them and delete#

na1 <- apply(train1, 2, function(x) sum(x %in% ""))

keep1 <- which(na1 == 0)

train2 <- train1[, keep1]

train2$classe = factor(train2$classe)

# column 1 and 2 are obviously useless in prediction #

train2 <- train2[,-c(1:2)]

#partition train2 data into training and crossvalidation#

inTrain <- createDataPartition(train2$classe, p = 0.6)[[1]]

training <- train2[ inTrain,]

crossvalidation <- train2[-inTrain,]

#try model specifications mentioned in the lecture#

mod1 <- train(classe ~ ., data=training, method="rf")

mod2 <- train(classe ~ ., data=training, method="gbm")

mod3 <- train(classe ~ ., data=training, method="lda")

```

```{r}
# see which method perform the best on training data #

pred1 <- predict(mod1,crossvalidation)

confusionMatrix(crossvalidation$classe, pred1)

```
```{r}

pred2 <- predict(mod2,crossvalidation)

confusionMatrix(crossvalidation$classe, pred2)

```
```{r}
pred3 <- predict(mod3,crossvalidation)

confusionMatrix(crossvalidation$classe, pred3)
```
```{r}

# Looks the random forest is the best#

# import testing data and clean it the same way as the training data #

test <- read.csv("/Users/wangshu/desktop/pml-testing.csv", header = T, )

test1 <- test [,keep]

test2 <- test1[, keep1]

test2 <- test2[, -c(1,2)]

prediction <- predict(mod1, test2)

prediction
```
```{r}
# SUMMARY: After deleting "X" and "name" variables in the dataset, random forest is the model I finally chose
# by comparing with methods gbm and lda
# out of sample error achieved 99.9% according to crossvalidation

```
